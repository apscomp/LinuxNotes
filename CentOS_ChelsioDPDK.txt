#Huge Pages prevent memory in these pages, to be paged to disk, so it is a big advantage
as root, open the file /etc/default/grub
#Either, append the following line to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX env. variable, if the cpu supports 1GB Huge Pages
   default_hugepagesz=1GB hugepagesz=1G hugepages=4 intel_iommu=on
#or, append the following line, if the CPU supports 2M HUGE PAGES

grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
